README: Data Analysis and Forecasting with R

Overview
This repository contains R scripts for data analysis and forecasting tasks. The scripts are organized into three main sections: clustering, regression, and time series analysis. Each section addresses different aspects of data manipulation, exploration, modeling, and visualization.

1. Clustering
Script: clustering.R

Purpose: Perform clustering analysis on a dataset to identify patterns and groupings.

Steps:

Data Import and Preprocessing:

Read a dataset (Different_stores_dataset.csv).
Compute new columns for total sales and profit.
Select relevant columns and normalize numeric variables.
Value Transformation:

Convert categorical variables to numeric.
Apply one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Matrix Transformation:

Transform the dataset into a matrix (data_matrix.csv).
Clustering with k-means:

Determine optimal clusters using within-cluster sum of squares.
Perform k-means clustering with k = 6.
Visualize cluster analysis using pairwise variable plots.

2. Regression
Script: regression.R

Purpose: Build regression models to understand factors influencing certain outcomes (e.g., turnover) across different countries.

Steps:

Data Import and Exploration:

Load datasets (data_matrix.csv and Chapter_6_Turnover_team_DATA.csv).
Summarize and explore datasets, identify outliers.
Exploration of Relationships:

Visualize relationships between variables using scatterplot matrix (splom function).
Calculate correlation matrix and visualize using corrplot.
Modeling:

Fit logistic regression models for each country (UK, USA, Canada, Spain) to predict binary outcomes.
Evaluate and summarize model performance.
Visualize model-specific relationships using boxplots.
Performance and Turnover Prediction:

Check for multicollinearity and prepare data.
Train linear regression models to predict performance and turnover.
Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

3. Time Series Analysis
Script: time_series.R

Purpose: Analyze and forecast time series data related to fish sales.

Steps:

Data Import and Preprocessing:

Read and preprocess time series data (Fish_dataset.csv).
Convert date format and plot the time series.
Outlier Detection and Handling:

Clean time series data using tsclean and take the logarithm.
Stationarity Check:

Check stationarity using differencing and ADF test.
Plot ACF and PACF to identify potential ARMA model parameters.
Modeling:

Identify the best ARIMA model using auto.arima.
Evaluate model residuals for adequacy (normality, white noise).
Refine model parameters based on diagnostic tests.
Forecasting:

Forecast future sales using the selected ARIMA model.
Visualize the forecasted values.

Conclusion
These scripts provide a comprehensive approach to exploring, modeling, and forecasting data using various statistical techniques in R. Each section is designed to sequentially process and analyze different types of data, making use of appropriate visualization and modeling methods.
